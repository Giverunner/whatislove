            The day started like any other: a quiet morning, the birds chirping softly outside my window, 
            the scent of fresh dew lingering in the air. 
            I grabbed my backpack and headed to the tuition class, 
            a modest little place in our neighborhood where students from different schools gathered for extra lessons. 
            It was a routine part of my day, something that had become almost second nature to me. 
            But that day, routine took a turn into the extraordinary.

            As I walked into the room, my eyes were immediately drawn to a new face. 
            Sitting at the far end of the classroom was a girl who seemed almost out of place in her beauty and grace. 
            She was fair-skinned, with an ethereal glow that caught the morning light just right. 
            Her name, I later learned, was Jyoti Upreti, but everyone affectionately called her Panchi, 
            which means bird in Hindi. 
            The nickname suited her perfectly, for there was something undeniably free-spirited and delicate about her.

            Panchi had big, beautiful eyes, the kind that seemed to hold entire stories within them. 
            They were as deep as the ocean, a mesmerizing shade of brown that seemed to change color in different lights. 
            Those eyes, though mostly downcast and shy, had a way of capturing your soul and holding it captive. 
            Her introverted nature was evident in the way she spoke—softly, sparingly, 
            as if she carefully weighed each word before letting it escape her lips. 
            She moved with a quiet grace, her presence subtle yet profoundly felt.

            Each day, I found myself increasingly drawn to her. 
            There was a certain magic in the way she carried herself, a blend of innocence and 
            quiet strength that intrigued me. 
            Panchi was unlike anyone I had ever met. 
            She was from Uttarakhand, like me, and this shared heritage gave me a strange sense of connection to her. 
            But it was more than just our common background that fascinated me. 
            It was everything about her—the way she tucked her hair behind her ear, 
            the slight smile that played on her lips when she was lost in thought, 
            the way her eyes sparkled with a hidden depth.
