            Finally, after everything we had been through, our relationship found its footing. 
            Things were back on track, but that didn't mean everything was perfect. We still had constant fights, but we learned to navigate through them. 
            We set boundaries and understood that arguments were a natural part of any relationship. 
            This realization allowed us to accept our differences and grow closer.

            We made it a point to meet every week, cherishing each other's company. The more we argued, the deeper our love seemed to grow. 
            We began to accept each other's faults, realizing that these imperfections made our relationship unique and strong. 
            Our love was tested time and again, but each argument only reinforced the bond we shared.

            The highlight of our journey came on March 29, 2024, our four-year anniversary. 
            Despite the ups and downs, we had never truly broken up, and this day was a testament to our enduring love. 
            We celebrated our anniversary with joy and excitement, marking it as the most precious and best day of our lives.

            We did so many new things together that day. We reminisced about our journey, shared our dreams, and made new promises. 
            We committed to each other in a way we never had before, acknowledging that while we might not have officially dated, 
            we had always considered ourselves married in spirit. This shared belief strengthened our relationship and made our bond unbreakable.

            During our celebration, Jyoti opened up about why she had pulled away in the past. 
            She confessed that she felt unwanted and feared losing me. Her attachment issues made her retreat to protect herself from potential heartbreak. 
            Listening to her, I realized how much she had struggled with these feelings. 
            I reassured her of my love and commitment, emphasizing the importance of communication.
