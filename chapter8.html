            When I finally gathered the courage to respond to Jyoti's message on Instagram, 
            it opened the door to a series of conversations that would bring back memories and 
            unravel the reasons behind her sudden departure.
            She explained that during that time, she wasn't interested in relationships and 
            needed to focus on her studies and personal growth. 
            She apologized for disappearing without any explanation, 
            but her tone was often judgy and critical of my life choices, 
            including my college and grades.

            Our conversations were a mix of nostalgia and tension. 
            I asked her if we could rekindle our relationship and live as we did before, 
            but she refused, saying that things had changed too much. 
            This led to constant arguments, but eventually, we agreed to keep each other in good books. 
            Over time, we transitioned from being acquaintances to good friends, and finally, 
            she called me her bestie.

            During this period, we flirted casually, and 
            it felt like we were rebuilding the connection we once had. 
            We even gave each other nicknamesâ€”mine was Saym, and hers was Jyo.
            These little moments brought us closer, and for the first time in years, 
            we exchanged photos. Seeing her again was surreal; 
            she looked just as beautiful as I remembered.

            As we reminisced about the past, she corrected me on important dates, 
            like our anniversary on March 29, 2020, the day we first expressed our love for each other. 
            It was a date I had always cherished, and 
            hearing her remember it so clearly made my heart swell with emotion.
