            After seeing Jyoti's "Hi" message, I couldn't shake the feeling of anticipation and anxiety. 
            Unsure of what to do, I decided to consult my friend. 
            He suggested a clever but unconventional method: using the "forgot password" 
            feature to verify the email or phone number associated with her account. 
            This method did provide some clues, but it didn't give us the full picture.

            Frustrated and still longing to reconnect, I decided to take a bolder step. 
            I remembered that I had her mother's phone number from the tuition group. 
            Though I had never messaged her before because I feared it might be risky, I felt I had no other choice. 
            I sent a message, hoping for the best.

            "Hey Bhawna, you there?" I typed, using the name of Jyoti's sister as a pretense to start the conversation. 
            I waited with bated breath, hoping this approach would work. To my relief, I received a reply.

            "Yes, who is this?" came the response.

            "It's Sanyam, from tuition," I replied, my heart pounding. "
            I was trying to get in touch with Jyoti. Is she around?"
