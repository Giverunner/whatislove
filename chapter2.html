            After that fateful day at the tuition, life carried on in its usual way. 
            The classes continued, the seasons changed, and soon, both Jyoti and 
            I had moved on to different stages in our academic journeys. 
            Despite never having exchanged more than a few glances, Jyoti had left an indelible mark on my heart. 
            Her silent grace, her captivating presence, and those deep, soulful eyes were memories I carried with me,
             even as our paths diverged.

            Three years passed, and I often wondered what had become of her. Did she remember me? 
            Did she think of those quiet moments we shared, even if they were only in my imagination? 
            My curiosity about her life remained, a small but persistent echo in the back of my mind.

            One day, in my 9th grade, my good friend Deeplika Bisht, who was almost like a sister to me, 
            asked if I would join her tuition classes at Paassion Tutorials. 
            Deeplika and I had grown up together, and we shared a bond that was both strong and uncomplicated. 
            Despite her earnest request, I refused, dismissing her tuition as a waste of time and money. 
            “No one goes there for real studies,” I scoffed, confident in my decision.

            But fate has a funny way of intervening when you least expect it.
            One afternoon, as we sat chatting about school and life, 
            Deeplika casually mentioned a girl from her tuition class. 
            “There's this very introverted, shy, and cute girl with a child-like voice,” she said. 
            The description struck a chord deep within me. My heart skipped a beat, and 
            a familiar feeling washed over me.

            “Wait,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. “What's her name?”

            Deeplika looked at me, puzzled by my sudden interest. “Her name is Jyoti Upreti.”

            Time seemed to stand still for a moment. It was her.
            The girl who had silently stolen my heart three years ago. 
            My heart began to race, and a flood of emotions came rushing back. 
            I needed to see her again.
