            Gradually, her attendance at tuition became irregular, and then one day, 
            she stopped coming altogether. 
            It was like a slow poison, watching her fade away from my life bit by bit. 
            Each day, the absence of her presence weighed heavily on me, affecting my concentration and mood. 
            I tried to keep up appearances in front of my friends, acting as if everything was normal. 
            “Yes, I'm single and happy,” I'd say, forcing a smile. 
            “Maybe I'll find a cute girl one day.” But inside, I was falling apart.

            I looked for her everywhere—our usual spots, social media, mutual friends—but she had vanished completely. 
            Every effort to reach her was met with silence. 
            Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, until one day, 
            I had to accept the painful reality: she was gone.

            Accepting her absence was one of the hardest things I ever had to do.
            Each day felt like a battle to stay afloat. The memories of our time together haunted me, and 
            every corner of our neighborhood seemed to echo with her laughter and presence. 
            I missed her deeply, but I had to move on. 
            I couldn't let my sorrow consume me entirely.

            So, I put on a brave face. I threw myself into my studies, sports, and spending time with friends. 
            Outwardly, I was the picture of normalcy, but inside, a part of me was always longing for her. 
            I wondered if she thought of me too, if she missed our conversations and shared moments as much as I did.

            The months passed, and slowly, the pain dulled. I began to accept that some things were beyond my control. 
            Life goes on, as they say, and I had to keep moving forward. 
            But no matter how much time passed, a part of me remained tethered to those memories, 
            to the girl who had once been such an integral part of my life.

            I realized that life doesn't always go as planned. 
            People come and go, and sometimes, the ones we cherish the most leave without warning. 
            All we can do is cherish the memories, learn from the experience, and hope for the best. 
            Despite everything, I held on to the hope that one day, our paths might cross again. 
            Until then, I had to find the strength to live my life fully, 
            carrying the lessons and memories of Jyoti with me.
