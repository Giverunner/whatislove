            As time went on, I lost all hope of ever seeing Jyoti again. 
            I tried to move on, but the ache of her absence was a constant reminder of what I had lost. 
            Eventually, I accepted the reality that she was gone for good and tried to focus on my life. 
            I threw myself into my studies and tried to find joy in the small things. 
            But deep down, a part of me was always searching for her, 
            longing for a glimpse of the girl who had once been my whole world.

            One afternoon, as I was coming back from school at 2:45, I saw her. 
            She was wearing a black mask and her school uniform, walking down the street. 
            My heart leapt into my throat. She was so close, yet so far. 
            I didn't have the guts to stop her, knowing it wasn't the right way to approach her and 
            that it might harm her reputation. 
            But just seeing her, even from a distance, brought a flicker of joy to my heart.

            From that day on, I timed my walk home to coincide with hers, 
            living for those brief moments when I could catch a glimpse of her. 
            It was a small comfort, but it gave me something to look forward to. However, 
            this fragile routine was short-lived. 
            One day, she was no longer there. I walked home alone, the sense of loss heavier than ever.

            Soon after, my board exams and entrance exams came. Distracted and demotivated, 
            I didn't do well in any of them. My disappointment was compounded when my father fell severely ill. 
            He developed a life-threatening infection, and my world crumbled around me.
            I was the one who had to take care of the household, and 
            seeing my father in such a vulnerable state was a near-death experience for me too. 
            It was the lowest point in my life.

            Through these challenges, I learned the value of perseverance. Despite the overwhelming odds, 
            I refused to give up. I focused on caring for my father and managing our household. Gradually, 
            my father recovered, and things started to improve. 
            I knew I had to keep moving forward, no matter how difficult it seemed.
