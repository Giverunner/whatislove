            Over the next few weeks, we continued to exchange small pleasantries. 
            Our conversations were brief and infrequent, but each one was a treasure to me. 
            Occasionally, we would sit together during class, 
            our silent companionship speaking volumes. 
            Gradually, our interactions became more frequent. We would walk together on the way to our homes, 
            our conversations growing longer and more comfortable.

            We never expressed it, but there was an unspoken understanding between us. 
            We would secretly wait for each other after class, 
            pretending it was just a coincidence when our paths crossed. 
            Each goodbye at the end of our walks was tinged with a promise of seeing each other again the next day.

            One day, during one of our walks, she mentioned she didn't have an Instagram account.
            “I use my sister's account sometimes,” she said, a hint of shyness in her voice.
            “Why don't you make one for yourself?” I asked, genuinely curious.
            “I don't know,” she replied, looking down. “I guess I never thought it was necessary.”
            “Well, it would be nice to talk to you there,” I suggested. “Plus, you can share your own pictures and thoughts.”
            She smiled, a little uncertain. “Maybe.”

            Over the next few days, I gently encouraged her to create her own account.
            We continued to communicate through her sister's account, our conversations growing deeper and more personal. 
            I learned about her dreams, her fears, and the things that made her happy. 
            Each message from her was like a window into her world, and I cherished every one.

            Finally, one evening, I received a message from a new account. It was Jyoti. “I did it,” she wrote. 
            “I made my own account.”
            I couldn't contain my excitement. “That's great! I'm so glad you did.”
            From that point on, our connection deepened even further. 
            We talked more freely, sharing thoughts and moments from our daily lives. 
            Our Instagram chats became a cherished part of my day, 
            a space where we could be ourselves without the constraints of our shy, introverted natures.
            Jyoti had always been the girl who captivated me with her silent grace, and now, 
            through our conversations and shared moments, I felt I was truly getting to know her. 
            Our relationship was still growing, but it was rooted in a genuine connection that went beyond words. 
            And as we continued to walk this path together, 
            I knew that every step brought us closer to something special.
