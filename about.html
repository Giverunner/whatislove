            I am <span class="highlight">Sanyam Rudola</span>, a student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE).

            This book is a heartfelt account of my experiences and feelings for the girl I love the most, <span class="highlight">Jyoti Upreti</span>.

            Jyoti is also a student, pursuing her B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE).

            Our story is unique and deeply personal—Jyoti and I don't live close enough to be considered neighbors, 
            but we're not so far apart that we can't be called neighbors either. This book shares our journey, 
            detailing how we experienced love and are still exploring it. 

            Through this narrative, I hope to convey the emotions, challenges, and beauty of our love, 
            offering insights into what it truly means to connect with someone special.

            Throughout our journey, we've encountered numerous struggles—misunderstandings, doubts, 
            and the trials of maintaining a long-distance relationship. 

            These challenges have tested our bond, but they've also strengthened our resolve to overcome them together. 

            In sharing our struggles, I aim to provide comfort and inspiration to others facing similar obstacles in their own relationships, 
            reminding them that love can conquer even the toughest of trials.
