            March 28th, 2020, I decided it was time to take a leap of faith. 
            My heart pounded as I typed out the message. “Hey, I have to tell you something I've been wanting to say for a long time.”
            Her response was immediate. “What is it?”
            I took a deep breath and continued. “The reason I changed my tuition... it was because of you. I love you, Jyoti.”
            There was a pause.
            My heart was in my throat, every second feeling like an eternity. 
            Finally, she replied, “I will reply tomorrow. I have to think.”
            That night was the longest of my life. 
            I tossed and turned, my mind racing with possibilities.
            Did she feel the same way? Was this the end of our friendship?

            The morning of March 29th, I woke up to a notification. 
            With trembling hands, I opened the message from Jyoti. “I love you too, Sanyam.”
            My heart soared. 
            We had crossed a bridge together, moving from friends to something more. 
            That day, we discussed everything—the reasons behind my decisions, the feelings we had both been too shy to express, 
            and how everyone around her had asked if she knew me. “It was obvious for me,” she said, laughing. “I was aware of your feelings.”

            The lockdown, despite its many challenges, gave us the time to nurture our new relationship. 
            We spent hours talking, sharing reels and memes, and laughing at the silliest things. 
            Of course, we had our fights—what couple doesn't? But each argument only brought us closer, helping us understand each other better.

            Finally, as the pandemic's grip loosened and life began to return to a semblance of normalcy, 
            we met in person at the start of our 11th-grade session. We chose the same teachers for our classes, eager to spend as much time together as possible. Seeing her in person again, after so many months of virtual interactions, was surreal. She was even more beautiful and graceful than I remembered, and our bond felt stronger than ever.

            Our journey continued from there, filled with shared classes, long walks home, and endless conversations. 
            We faced the ups and downs of teenage life together, supporting each other through every challenge. 
            Our relationship, which had started with stolen glances and hesitant hellos, had blossomed into a deep, enduring love.
