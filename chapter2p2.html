            That evening, I went home and spoke to my mom. 
            “Mom, I want to join Paassion Tutorials,” I said, trying to sound casual. 
            My mom raised an eyebrow, surprised by my sudden change of heart. 
            After all, I had spent the past few months ridiculing those very tuition classes.

            “Why the sudden interest?” she asked, suspicion evident in her voice.

            “I think it could be helpful for my studies,” I lied, 
            though my real motivation had nothing to do with academics. 
            Convincing her wasn't easy, but after some persistence, 
            she finally agreed to get me admitted there next month.

            In the meantime, I couldn't wait. 
            I started visiting Deeplika and another friend who was also attending those classes. 
            I timed my visits perfectly, arriving just as their classes were ending, hoping to catch a glimpse of Jyoti. 
            Each time, my heart would pound with anticipation. And when I saw her, it was as if the years melted away. 
            She was even more beautiful and graceful than I remembered. 
            Her eyes still held that mysterious depth, and her presence still captivated me.

            Finally, the day came when I officially joined Paassion Tutorials. 
            Walking into that classroom, knowing she would be there, filled me with a mix of excitement and nervousness. 
            I found a seat where I could see her clearly, and as the class began, 
            I tried to focus on the lesson, though my mind was entirely elsewhere.

            Jyoti may never have known the extent of my feelings, but in my heart, 
            she was always the girl who had captured my soul with her silent beauty and grace. 
            Even if I never had the courage to speak to her, 
            being near her once again was more than I could have ever hoped for. 
            Watching her, listening to her child-like voice that others made fun of but I found endearing,
            was a daily reminder of the silent connection we once had and the hope that perhaps, one day, 
            I would find the courage to turn my silent admiration into words.
