            We exchanged a few more messages, and I explained the situation to Bhawna. 
            She was understanding and suggested that it would be better for me to reply to Jyoti directly on Instagram ,
            rather than trying to get her number through other means. 
            Her advice made sense; it was less invasive and more respectful.

            Taking Bhawna's advice to heart, I decided to gather my courage and respond to Jyoti's message on Instagram. 
            The next day, with my heart racing, I opened the chat and typed my reply.
            
            "Hi Jyoti, it's been a long time. How have you been?"
            
            The message was simple, but it carried the weight of all the emotions and memories of the past years. 
            I hit send, hoping that this would be the start of a renewed connection.
            
            With the message sent, I felt a mix of nervousness and relief. 
            I had taken the step I had been hesitating to take.
            Now, all I could do was wait and hope that Jyoti would respond, opening a new chapter in our story.
