            Everything seemed to be going well in our lives. 
            Jyoti and I had settled into a comfortable routine, balancing our studies and our blossoming relationship. 
            We shared moments of joy, fought occasionally, and always made up with a deeper understanding of each other. 
            Our daily walks home and late-night chats became the highlights of my day. 
            But then, slowly, things began to change.

            It started subtly. Jyoti began spending less time online. 
            Where she once responded to my messages almost immediately, now her replies came hours later. 
            At first, I didn't think much of it. 
            We were both busy with schoolwork, and I figured she had a lot on her plate. 
            But as days turned into weeks, her online presence dwindled even further. 
            She would answer once a day, then once every two days, and eventually, only once in three days.

            Concerned, I asked her if everything was alright. 
            She reassured me with brief, vague responses that everything was fine and that she was just busy. 
            Despite her words, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong.

            One day, as I logged into Instagram, I noticed that her account was deactivated. 
            Panic surged through me. I tried to reach her through every possible means, but there was no response. 
            My mind raced with worst-case scenarios, and I couldn't help but fear the worst.

            The next day, on our way to tuition, I finally saw her. 
            With a breaking voice, she said, “My sister did it. She deactivated my account.” 
            I knew there was more to the story, but I didn't press her for details. 
            I suspected she needed to focus on her studies, and 
            perhaps this was her way of taking a break from distractions. 
            Respecting her need for space, I decided not to disturb her too much, even though it hurt deeply.
