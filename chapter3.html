            The day I was to join Paassion Tutorials, 
            my heart was beating so fast it felt like it would leap out of my chest. 
            The anticipation of seeing Jyoti again was almost overwhelming. 
            As I approached the classroom, my palms grew sweaty, and 
            my mind raced with a mix of excitement and nervousness. 
            I took a deep breath, trying to calm myself, and pushed open the door.

            The classroom was filled with the usual chatter of students, but my eyes immediately sought her out. 
            There she was, sitting near the window, her profile illuminated by the soft morning light. 
            She looked serene, engrossed in her book, her big, 
            beautiful eyes scanning the pages with quiet concentration. 
            I found a seat where I could see her clearly, yet not too close to make my interest obvious.

            As I settled in, I tried to focus on the lesson, but my mind was entirely elsewhere. 
            Every now and then, I stole glances at her, my heart racing each time. 
            I wondered if she had noticed me, if she remembered me from our earlier tuition days. 
            The class seemed to drag on forever, and I could hardly wait for it to end.

            Finally, during a break, I gathered enough courage to approach her. 
            My heart pounded as I walked over to her desk. 
            “Hi, Jyoti,” I said, my voice trembling slightly.
            She looked up, surprised, her eyes meeting mine. 
            For a moment, I thought I saw a flicker of recognition. “Hi,” she replied softly, 
            a small smile forming on her lips.
            “How have you been?” I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.
            “I've been good,” she said, her voice as gentle and soothing as I remembered. “How about you?”
            “I'm good too,” I replied, feeling a warmth spread through me at this small, 
            but significant interaction. It was a start, and I cherished it.
