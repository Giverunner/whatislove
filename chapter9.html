            Everything was going well between Jyoti and me. Our conversations, the playful banter, and the exchange of photos brought us closer. 
            However, as time passed, I began to feel uneasy about our relationship. We were so close, yet there was no formal commitment between us. 
            It felt wrong to be this emotionally involved without defining our relationship.

            One evening, I decided to bring it up. “Jyoti,” I said, taking a deep breath, “I think it's high time we commit to each other. 
            I don't really like dating either, but we need to make this official. It feels wrong to be this close without any proper relationship.”

            Jyoti's reaction was not what I expected. She seemed taken aback and defensive. 
            “Why do we need to label it? We're fine the way we are,” she argued.

            This led to a heated argument that lasted for three days. We were constantly texting and calling each other, trying to make our points. 
            The days were filled with tension and frustration, as neither of us was willing to back down. 
            I felt strongly that our relationship needed clarity, while she was resistant to the idea of committing.

            Finally, after days of arguing, something shifted. Jyoti called me late at night, her voice soft and tired. 
            “Sanyam,” she began, “I've been thinking a lot about what you said. And you're right. 
            I love you too, and I want us to be committed to each other.”

            Hearing those words made my heart soar. I was overjoyed and couldn't contain my happiness. 
            We started planning our future together, discussing everything from our marriage to how many kids we wanted and their names. 
            We even talked about when and where we would get married. It felt surreal to share these dreams with her, and it brought us even closer.
