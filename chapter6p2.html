            Eventually, I took admission to a new college, Sharda University. It was a bittersweet moment. 
            I was sad to leave behind the familiar, but I was also hopeful for a new beginning. 
            I saw it as an opportunity to change my life and start anew.

            One day, a senior at my college asked if I had ever dated someone. 
            The question caught me off guard, and I responded awkwardly. 
            The sadness of the memories washed over me, and 
            I found myself praying to God for some relief from the pain that still lingered in my heart.

            That evening, as I scrolled through Instagram, I noticed a notification. 
            I had a new message request. My heart skipped a beat as I opened it.
            It was from Jyoti Upreti. She had sent a simple "Hi."

            As I stared at the "Hi" message from Jyoti, a rush of emotions flooded over me. 
            Part of me wanted to reply immediately, to pour out all the thoughts and 
            feelings that had been bottled up inside me for so long. 
            But another part hesitated, afraid of what her response might be.

            I needed time to gather my thoughts, 
            to process the whirlwind of emotions that her message had stirred within me. 
            So, I made a decision. I would reply the next day, 
            after I had carefully considered what to say.

            That night, as I lay in bed, I couldn't shake the feeling of anticipation. 
            What would I say to her? How would she react? Despite the uncertainty, 
            a glimmer of hope sparked within me. 
            Perhaps this was the beginning of a new chapter in our story, 
            a chance to rebuild what had been lost.

            With that thought in mind, I drifted off to sleep, 
            dreaming of the possibilities that tomorrow might bring.
