        Jyoti finally creating her own Instagram account marked a turning point in our relationship. 
        After weeks of gentle encouragement, she sent me a message from her new account one evening. 
        “I did it,” she wrote. “I made my own account.”

        I couldn't contain my excitement. 
        “That's great! I'm so glad you did,” I replied, a wide grin spreading across my face.

        From that point on, our connection deepened. We talked more freely, sharing thoughts and moments from our daily lives. 
        Our Instagram chats became a cherished part of my day, a space where we could be ourselves without the constraints of our shy, introverted natures.

        Then, the world changed. 
        The COVID-19 pandemic hit, and suddenly, our lives were turned upside down. 
        Schools and tuitions closed, and everyone was forced to stay home. 
        The uncertainty and fear were palpable, but there was one silver lining: 
        Jyoti and I now had more time to talk.

        We spent New Year's Eve of 2020 chatting, sharing our hopes and fears for the coming year. 
        The world outside was filled with chaos, but our conversations provided a sense of normalcy and comfort. 
        We laughed, we dreamed, and for those moments, it felt like everything would be okay as long as we had each other.
